# Java exercises by Federico Rosales
Hello, my name is Federico Rosales, I have been a Systems Engineer since 2019. I have had an extensive career as a backend developer working for clients such as BBVA Banco Frances, Sancor Seguros and as an employee of MercadoLibre.
In this repository you will find everything related to the Java language.


# Proyects

In this section I am going to upload all the exercises developed and learned throughout my journey as a Java developer. In each folder or package I will be explaining what each topic is about.

## Advanced Java

In the review project, I summarize two projects: Pizzeria and VideoClub. In both I try to carry out the correct implementations of variables, operators, data entry, string management, loops, arrays, functions, OOP, Java Beans, exception handling and Lists.

> **Attention:** These projects can be found in the **packages** **advanced.pizzeria** and **advanced.videoclub**
