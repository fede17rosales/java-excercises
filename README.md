# Java exercises by Federico Rosales
Hello, my name is Federico Rosales, I have been a Systems Engineer since 2019. I have had an extensive career as a backend developer working for clients such as BBVA Banco Frances, Sancor Seguros and as an employee of MercadoLibre.
In this repository you will find everything related to the Java language.


# Proyects

In this section I am going to upload all the exercises developed and learned throughout my journey as a Java developer. In each folder or package I will be explaining what each topic is about.

## Advanced Java

In the review project, I summarize two projects: Pizzeria and VideoClub. In both I try to carry out the correct implementations of variables, operators, data entry, string management, loops, arrays, functions, OOP, Java Beans, exception handling and Lists.

> **Attention:** These projects can be found in the **packages** **advanced.pizzeria** and **advanced.videoclub**

## Database with Java

In this section I show a small example of a 3-tier architecture with a connection to MySQL. For the management and construction of this project, Maven and the JDBC API were used to connect with the MySQL database management system.

> **Attention:** This project can be divided into the **packages presentation, conexcion, data, domain** and **service**.

In this project, what was learned with Spring is put into practice, management of dependency injection with maven, use of the lombok library, connection with mysql, implementation of docker and AWS.

> **Attention:** This project can be divided into the **packages controller, repository, entity** and **service**.
